This is a simple shopping list program.
The user is prompted on how big their list will be. The user will then individually enter the item names and prices of each item.
The user is then asked if they wish to export the their list onto a text file and if they wish the clear the list. If they wish to export
to a new file, it creates a new file called shoppingList.txt and saves it into their current working directory.
